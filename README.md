Experiment 1
Date Sept 31


What?
Choral Audio Test 01
https://soundcloud.com/boblet/choral-audio-test-01/s-8kBu3


I create a choral audio test - based on some white noise and samples of the voice I aimed to look at giving a computer a voice. I wanted to see if I could create something that wouldnt be too boring that created the sound of the 


Concept - Why Did I do this?
In or


Ambition - Why does this matter?
To give 


Results - why 
I personally like the results - however the response from the group triggered a range of emotions


Boredom from some - and I agree
Others thought it too continuous….that there was no breath to the voices
This is an interesting comment

Experiment 2
Date Oct


What
Mini mix
https://soundcloud.com/boblet/dmsa-listening-guide-minimix


Concept - Why Did I do this?
I wanted to create a little point of reference to my historic work to ensure that aesthetically I do not (or do) deviate from the work that has come before


Ambition - Why does this matter?
I wanted to maintain some core aesthetics from previous projects


Results - why 
I can already see by adding in the last experiment that to the end of the mix that I need to be more aggressive in my sound choices

Experiment 3
Date 


What
Live jam with new sounds alongside my normal pallet of sounds to refind the work that I was doing before. Utilising my live set with some of the washes from previous experiments and using some fm synth work with heavy overdrive I created some other controllers using theramins as input.

Concept - Why Did I do this?
To try and find a more active sound pallet that is more in keeping with my previous work




Ambition - Why does this matter?
I wish to build on my work rather than reinvent the work. 


Results - 
The results are much more aesthetically pleasing. It maintains my connection to club culture that was missing, but I feel that the sound could be pushed further. The use of a guitar as an instrument and the theremin reflect some of the work I am trying to build with

Utilising Lyrebird as a voice generation program….

VIA


Concept - Why Did I do this?
I want to be able to give voice to machines - and I thought that some tests with actual machine generated voices could be useful.


Ambition - Why does this matter?
I am looking to capture participants voices - currently this has been touted as a fast way to create machine generated voices...


Results - why 
I was hoping that the voices would be more like myself - however currently they are far too synthetic. Any quality is MASKED by the digital nature of the voices…..

What

Slit scan experiment


Concept - Why Did I do this?
I want to record people in time and get them to move their movement and behavior being used to generate and alter the composition. - for them to react I need something ‘fun’ just as the major sp’s like google  use services to extract behavior as a surplus.I built a series of magic ‘mirrors’ that look at video over time...


Ambition - Why does this matter?


Results - why 
The slit scan is a great part as it utilises the body as its input and shows that people are being recorded.

Live jam with some body controled modular synths built in RACK and processing
I reworked this into a composition

Concept - Why Did I do this?
To see what kind of sounds were created by using the body - and if they can be tuned to an existing composition. Utilising signal data

What
Lighting test Millimin 
Concept - Why Did I do this?
I want to create a surrounding entity to the interactions - a feeling of envelopment. I want to see if I can create reactions within millimin to control a simple dmx lighting rig and screen that reacts to 


Ambition - Why does this matter?
I wanted to maintain focus in the installation


Results - why 
The experiment was slightkly unsuccesful there needs to be a smaller throw to the lights - maybe some LED strips would be more useful and control them

What
Facial recognition test

Ambition - Why does this matter?
After the thesis I wish to explore sounds ability to target the body at a distance - facial recognition is one of the those issues

What
Facial recognition test
https://github.com/boblete/frst-MA-DMSA

Ambition - Why does this matter?
First test combining facial recognition software and react


Results - Why 
So this is the first test at seeing if we can make the webapp porthin - the test is totally successful - I am able to make a fingerprint in data of faces based on FACE-API then test to see if the Algorhythm will find them again - this totally works - scanned every member of the family and having a full face recognition test - need to find the bias issues noted in the git-lab - the software allegedly fails on non-biased faces - we need to set a timeout on the camera / recognition connection  - and also if the face returns undefined then we request that they store them - 

This has sparked thoughts about how the app should work - the web portion should reveal and allow us to surrepticiously collect information about the user.

So we can get their IP address - 
We could ask them to post their fingerprint - sharing is an excellent circumnavigator of security as peoples willingness to sousveil themselves and share themselves will be key to gleaming information from them. -> shre location add nsa hashtag to a tweet along with a visual fingerprint.

What if the installation does nothing unless you sign up - your face goes ignored unless registered? what does that say? 

We should be able to give a multilayered
